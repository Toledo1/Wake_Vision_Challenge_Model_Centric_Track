Report on ResNetLiteDepthwise

This repository contains the following important files:
- model_centric_track_v1.py: this file contains the model and the training process
- wv_k_8_c_5.tflite: the trained model file which is very light and appropriated for low ressource devices

In this work,we designed a light CNN architecture termed ResNetLiteDepthwise to accurately classify wake vision images. The model is based on Resnet backbone
in which standard convolution blocks have been replaced by the light depthwise convolution blocks to reduce the model complexity and residual connexions were 
useful to improve the gradiant flow in the deep architecture.
